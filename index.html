        <p class="home-p">India, officially known as the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a South Asian nation renowned for its rich culture, traditions, historical landmarks, temples, forts, and palaces. Some of the most famous monuments include the Old Churches of Goa, the Taj Mahal, Qutab Minar in Delhi, Charminar, Red Fort, and Jantar Mantar, which are among the most visited heritage sites in the country. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" target="_blank">Read more.</a></p>

      <p class="Taj-Mahal">The Taj Mahal, meaning 'Crown of the Palace,' is an ivory-white marble mausoleum situated on the right bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, India. Built in 1632 by the Mughal emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Jahan" target="_blank">Shah Jahan</a> (r. 1628–1658), it was designed to house the tomb of his beloved wife, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumtaz_Mahal" target="_blank">Mumtaz Mahal</a>. Shah Jahan's tomb also rests here. At the heart of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, the Taj Mahal includes a mosque, a guest house, and formal gardens, all enclosed by a crenellated wall on three sides.</p>

    <p class="Red-Fort">The Red Fort, or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]), is a historic fort in Old Delhi, India, that served as the primary residence of the Mughal emperors. Its construction was commissioned by Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Jahan" target="_blank">Shah Jahan</a> on 12 May 1638, when he decided to relocate his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, the fort's design was created by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the architect behind the Taj Mahal. Representing the pinnacle of Mughal architecture during Shah Jahan's reign, the fort blends Persian and Indian design traditions. On 15 August 1947, India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the national flag at the Lahori Gate. Since then, the Prime Minister hoists the tricolour flag every Independence Day (15 August) and delivers a speech broadcast nationwide from its ramparts.</p>

    <p>The Qutb Minar was constructed over the remnants of Lal Kot, the citadel of Dhillika. Its construction began after the establishment of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, initiated around 1192 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_al-Din_Aibak" target="_blank">Qutb-ud-din Aibak</a>, the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. The tower is generally believed to be named after Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who started its construction. However, it is also possible that it was named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutbuddin_Bakhtiar_Kaki" target="_blank">Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki</a>, a 13th-century Sufi saint, as Shamsuddin Iltutmish, another ruler, was a devotee of his.</p>

    <p>The Charminar, meaning 'four minarets,' was built in 1591 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Quli_Qutb_Shah" target="_blank">Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah</a>, the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, after he moved his capital from Golkonda to the newly established city of Hyderabad. Located in Hyderabad, Telangana, the monument is a globally recognized symbol of the city and is among the most iconic structures in India. The Charminar is also featured as the official Emblem of Telangana. With a history spanning over 400 years, it includes a mosque on its top floor, which has remained a place of worship since its construction.</p>

    <p>The Hawa Mahal, located in Jaipur, India, is a stunning palace constructed from red and pink sandstone. Positioned on the edge of the City Palace, it connects to the Zenana, or women's chambers. 

      Built in 1799 by Maharaja <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratap_Singh_of_Jaipur" target="_blank">Sawai Pratap Singh</a>, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the city's founder, the palace was inspired by the unique design of the Khetri Mahal. 
      
      Designed by Lal Chand Ustad, the Hawa Mahal's five-story facade resembles a honeycomb, featuring 953 small windows, or *Jharokhas*, adorned with intricate latticework.</p>

    <p>The Stupa No. 2 at Sanchi, also known as Sanchi II, is one of the oldest surviving Buddhist stupas in India and is part of the Sanchi Buddhist complex in Madhya Pradesh. It is particularly significant for containing some of the earliest known decorative reliefs in India, likely predating those at the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya and the reliefs at Bharhut. This stupa is noted for having "the oldest extensive stupa decoration in existence," and is considered the birthplace of Jataka illustrations.

    <p>The Konark Sun Temple, built in the 13th century CE (around 1250), is located about 35 kilometers (22 miles) northeast of Puri on the coastline of Odisha, India. It is attributed to King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narasingha_Deva_I" target="_blank">Narasimhadeva I</a> of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. 

      Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, the temple’s remaining structure resembles a 100-foot (30 m) high chariot, complete with large stone-carved wheels and horses. Originally over 200 feet (61 m) tall, much of the temple is now in ruins, including the large shikara tower that once rose far higher than the remaining mandapa. The surviving structures are known for their detailed artwork, iconography, and themes, including erotic kama and mithuna scenes. Also referred to as the Surya Devalaya, the temple is a prime example of Odisha’s Kalinga-style architecture.</p>

    <p>The India Gate, formerly known as the All India War Memorial, is located on the Rajpath in New Delhi, at the eastern edge of the city's ceremonial axis, once called Kingsway. It commemorates the 90,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who lost their lives between 1914 and 1921 during World War I in places such as France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli, and other regions, as well as in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. The names of 13,300 servicemen, including some from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate. Designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Lutyens" target="_blank">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, the gate's design is inspired by the memorial arch style, similar to the Arch of Constantine in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.</p>

    <p>The Ajanta Caves are a group of around 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments located in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India. Dating from the 2nd century BCE to about 480 CE, these caves feature paintings and sculptures that are considered some of the finest surviving examples of ancient Indian art. The expressive paintings, known for conveying emotions through gesture, pose, and form, are particularly admired.

      The caves are regarded as masterpieces of Buddhist religious art. They were constructed in two phases: the first starting around the 2nd century BCE, and the second from 400 to 650 CE, though later research suggests a shorter period between 460–480 CE. The site is a protected monument managed by the Archaeological Survey of India, and since 1983, the Ajanta Caves have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

    <p>The Golden Temple, also known as the Harmandir Sahib (meaning 'abode of God') or the Darbār Sahib ('exalted court'), is a gurdwara located in Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is the most important spiritual site in Sikhism.

      The man-made pool surrounding the temple was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577. In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in the Harmandir Sahib. The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt after being targeted and destroyed several times by the Mughal Empire, political groups, and invading Afghan armies. After founding the Sikh Empire, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjit_Singh" target="_blank">Maharaja Ranjit Singh</a> reconstructed it in marble and copper in 1809, and in 1830, he covered the sanctum with gold leaf, earning it the name "Golden Temple."</p>
